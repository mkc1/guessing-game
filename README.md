GUESSING GAME PROJECT OVERVIEW

The guessing game tests your basic knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery. The game is simple, guess a number between 1-100. The app should respond and indicate if you should guess higher or lower. The app should also tell you if you are "getting hotter" if you are within 10 numbers of the winning number.
